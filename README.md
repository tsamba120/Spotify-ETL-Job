# Spotify ETL Job & Weekly Metrics Email
This is a data engineering-focused project that performs an ETL job of my Spotify listening data and sends me an automated email of my weekly listening habits. I used Python and SQL to build the ETL script, PostgreSQL database, and email script. I also used Airflow to build DAGs to schedule and monitor the daily ETL and weekly email jobs.
